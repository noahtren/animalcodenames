# Animal Codenames
UUIDs are nice, but sometimes you just want a quick, arbitrary
identifier that is easy to tell apart from others. What better way to do this than with
colorful animals?

```python
>>> from animalcodenames import gen_name
>>> gen_name()
'Happy-Purple-Baboon-34'
>>> gen_name()
'Mysterious-Violet-Lion-39'
>>> gen_name()
'Gentle-Orange-Rabbit-28'
```
